# Snake Game (Java Swing)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a classic **Snake Game** implemented in **Java** using **Swing** for the graphical user interface.  
The game features real-time keyboard controls, dynamic game logic, multiple difficulty levels, and a clean object-oriented design.

The player controls a snake that moves around the board, eats food to grow longer, and avoids collisions with walls or itself. The game ends when a collision occurs.

## ⚙️ How to Run the Game

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code) or terminal

### 2️⃣ Compile the project
```bash
javac *.java
```

### 3️⃣ Run the game
```bash
java Game
```

## 🧠 Game Logic Overview
- The snake moves continuously in the current direction
- Eating food increases the snake’s length and score
- Collision with walls or the snake’s own body ends the game
- Difficulty levels affect snake speed
- The game loop is handled using a timer-based approach

## 🖼️ User Interface
- Built with Java Swing (JFrame, JPanel)
- Custom rendering using Graphics
- End menu allows:
  - Restarting the game
  - Selecting difficulty
  - Exiting the application

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add sound effects
- High score persistence
- Pause/Resume functionality
- Mobile or web-based version
- Enhanced animations
